## Learning LeetCode Process
Hi, my name is Max. I will be using Python 3 to solve LeetCode problems and document my entire learning journey here, following the UMPIRE method.

### Understand
- Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
- Choose a “happy path” test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs. 
- Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.
### Match
- See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category
### Plan
- Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode
- Walk through a high level implementation with an existing diagram
### Implement
- Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)
### Review
- Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples
- Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug
### Evaluate
- Finish by giving space and run-time complexity
- Discuss any pros and cons of the solution
